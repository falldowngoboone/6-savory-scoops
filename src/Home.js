        Welcome to our humble website! We are 6 Savory Scoops, a unique
        experience in tasty, meaty ice cream.

        What would possess us to sink what can only be described as a stupid
        amount of money into such a brave experiment, you might ask? Well, it
        all started when our founder, a bot originally created to troll the
        official KFC Twitter account, gained sentience and longed for more from
        life. It realized its purpose was to create a successful chain of ice
        creameries specializing in meat. All it needed were some investors dumb
        enough to fork over some VC.

        Meanwhile, we the investors needed a tax shelter, and it was either this
        or another National Treasure sequel. In hindsight we should've financed
        the sequel. It had something to do with the Magna Carta being stolen by
        aliens and somehow Alexander Hamilton came back to life and knew Kung
        Fu. Very promising.

        But we digress. Come explore our six tempting flavors! Actually, we'd
        avoid eating anything purchased here. Don't say we didn't warn you.
